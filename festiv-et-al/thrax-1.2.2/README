Thrax - Release 1.2.2

Thrax is a toolkit for compiling grammars based on regular expressions and
context-dependent rewrite rules into weighted finite-state transducers
(FSTs). The FST representation uses OpenFst.

REQUIREMENTS:
  This version is known to work under Linux and MacOS using g++ (>=
  4.2). Expected to work wherever adequate POSIX (dlopen, ssize_t, basename),
  c99 (snprintf, strtoll, <stdint.h>), and C++11 with GNU extensions are
  available.

  It is assumed you have OpenFst (www.openfst.org) 1.5.2 or higher and have
  installed it.

  MAKE SURE YOU CONFIGURE OpenFst WITH THE --enable-far, --enable-pdt AND
  --enable-mpdt FLAGS.

INSTALLATION:
  Follow the generic GNU build system instructions in ./INSTALL.  We
  recommend configuring with =--enable-static=no= for faster
  compiles.

  Configuring with --enable-bin=no excludes the command line utilities (not
  generally useful).

  Configuring with --enable-readline enables readline (in-line editing) for
  thraxrewrite-tester. You must have GNU readline installed.

  Compiling with '-Wall -Wno-sign-compare' under g++ should give no
  warnings from this library.

USAGE:
  Assuming you've installed under the default /usr/local, the GRM binaries are
  found on /usr/local/bin. Headers will be in /usr/local/include/thrax, and
  libraries in /usr/local/lib.

  Auxiliary data files -- provided grammars -- are under /usr/local/share/thrax.
  Syntax highlighters (for vi and emacs) and other useful tools are under
  /usr/local/share/utils.

  To use in your own programs you will need to include <thrax/thrax.h>. Compile
  with '-I /usr/local/include' and link against /usr/local/lib/libfst.so,
  /usr/local/lib/fst/libfstfar.so and /usr/local/lib/libthrax.so

  The linking is, by default, dynamic so that the Fst and Arc type DSO
  extensions can be used correctly if desired.

  See www.opengrm.org for general documentation.
