Thrax - Release 0.1

This is the alpha version.

Thrax - Release 1.0

* Removed dependency on ICU for UTF8 string parsing: --with-icu configuration
  flag no longer needed and OpenFst library version 1.3.1 or above is required. 
* Function definitions may now be interleaved with the rest of the body in grammars.
* Support for standard (tropical), log and log64 arc types (flag --arc_type).
* --save_symbols flag to thraxcompiler allows for symbol tables to be stored in the compiled fsts.
  thraxmakedep supports --arc_type and --save_symbols flags.
* StringFile function now supports construction of both acceptors and
  transducers. Strings may be compiled in byte or utf8 mode, or with a
  user-specified symbol table. 
* The --rule flag to thraxrewrite-tester is now --rules. Supports a
  comma-separated list of rule names, which are to applied in sequence to the
  input. 
* Project added as callable function.
* Various optimizations to CDRewrite and elsewhere.
* Fixed bug in how symbol tables are saved (1.0.1)
* Fixed bug in treatment of symbol tables with StringFile
* Adopted SET_FLAGS for better presentation of flag options

Thrax - Release 1.1

* Added interface to pushdown transducer (PDT) functionality from OpenFst.
* Added support for morphological paradigms and linguistic features.
* Added assertion capability to allow for self-testing grammars.
* Added readline support to thraxrewrite-tester to allow for inline editing and saving
  of histories.
* Added thraxrandom-generator to allow one to generate random strings from a
  grammar.
* Added more useful debug information --- grammar file name and line number ---
  to allow more one to find bugs in the grammar more easily.
* Generated labels are now output in readable form by thraxrewrite-tester and
  thraxrandom-generator.
* Generated labels (enclosed in "[]") may no longer be single-character.
* Allow ASSERT_EQUAL declarations in the grammar.


Thrax - Release 1.2

* Added interface to multi-pushdown transducer (MPDT) functionality from OpenFst.
* Added interface to Replace class in OpenFst.
* Adds --show_details flag to thraxrewrite-tester. When it is set and when
  multiple rules  are specified, the tool will show the output of each
  individual rule. Useful when trying to find which rule caused a problem.
* Raises a warning if more than one definition is given for a function.

Thrax - Release 1.2.1
* AssertNull and AssertEmpty assertions added.
* Minor fixes to use fully qualified names for std:: objects.
* Rearrangement of the main compiler to have separate C++ files for each arc type.
* Fixes potential bug in Replace implementation.
* Algorithmic improvements to Optimize.

Thrax - Release 1.2.2

* Compatibility release for OpenFst 1.5.2.
